# Reconsidering Deep Ensembles 

This repository contains code for the manuscript "Reconsidering Deep Ensembles". Here we provide information for how to regenerate figures 1, 2 and 4 of the corresponding paper. 

## Installation 
We highly recommend usage of a GPU backed machine in order to reproduce the figures here. CPU only based usage is not tested.  

You will need to install the dependencies found in the requirements.txt file in order to reproduce figures. We recommend doing so in a [conda](https://www.anaconda.com) virtual environment. Once you have installed conda, check your installation by running:

```
conda list
```

Then create a new environment as follows: 

```
conda create -n env_name python=3.7
```

Now move into the root directory of this repo:
```
cd /path/to/this/repo
```

Activate your new environment, install dependencies and python package: 
```
conda activate env_name
conda install pip 
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ./src
```


## Figures 1 and 2 setup:
To regenerate Figures 1 and 2, please use the repo linked as "compare_performance" in the manuscript.

### Retrieving data
In order to replicate figures, you will need to load the datasets given at [this zenodo link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6582653). Please add upload the contents into the "results" directory of this repo. 

### Figure 1 
Figure 1 is generated using the script `scripts/plot_conditional_variance.py`. Please navigate to the directory `scripts` before running the commands below.
Figure 1 results can be regenerated in two steps, corresponding to the two sets of ensembles used. 
- Row 1: 
```
python plot_conditional_variance.py
```
- Row 2: 
```
python plot_conditional_variance.py "+all_imagenet_ood@=config_AlexNet_imagenetv2mf_Var.yaml"
```

### Figure 2 
Figure 2 is generated using the script `scripts/paperfigs/compare_performance.py`
Figure 2 results can be generated in two steps, corresponding to the two pairs of ensemble/single models used. 
- Left Column: 
```
python compare_performance.py "+cifar10_1_bs@=config.yaml"
```
- Right Column: 
```
python compare_performance.py "+cinic10_bs@=config.yaml"
```

## Figure 4 setup:
To regenerate Figure 4, please use the repo linked as "imagenet_pl" in the manuscript

### Retrieving data
Please see the instructions in `etc/ekb/README.md` on how to download and prepare data. 

## Figure 4 
Navigate to the directory `etc/ekb/plot`, and please run the following:

```
store_.sh
```
